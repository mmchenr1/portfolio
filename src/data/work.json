They praised certain elements of our design, most notably our flows that rewarded users for filling out their profile information with more customizable options. They also enjoyed our new feature that we titled \"party anthem\", which allows the users to put a song in their profile. However, they expressed that they would like the ability for the song to play continuously while the user was on the profile if that was possible. Interestingly enough, some of our concepts and designs were similar to features that the founders are working on or had considered before, including the idea of different tiers of mutuals (such as displaying the number of shared mutuals two users have). They were interested in the user research we conducted with our peers, and we discussed why users may be hesitant to fill out their profile information and Gen-Z disillusionment with emojis."
